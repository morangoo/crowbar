## How to contribute

1. 🍴 **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `dev`.
2. 🛠️ **Fix a bug, add a feature, or sprinkle some magic** (typo fixes and docs are welcome too!).
3. 📬 **Open a pull request** with a clear (and maybe witty) description.
4. 💬 **Big idea?** Open an issue first so we can brainstorm together! Collaboration = ❤️
5. ✅ **Check your code**: follow the style, pass all tests, and make those checkmarks go green! 🟢

## Code of Conduct

🤝 Be kind, be inclusive, and treat everyone like a teammate. We welcome everyone—no gatekeeping, just good vibes!
<br>🌈 Diversity makes us stronger!

## Issues

- 🔍 Before opening a new issue, take a peek—maybe someone already had the same idea!
- 🖼️ The more details, screenshots, and context you provide, the faster we can help (and the more fun we have).

## Pull Requests

- ✨ Keep PRs focused and small if possible (tiny PRs = happy maintainers).
- 🔗 Reference related issues in your PR description (we love connections!).
- 🧪 Add tests for new features or bug fixes when applicable. Tests = confidence!
